/**
 * @assertion Let E be an export directive that refers to a URI via the string
 * s1. Evaluation of E proceeds as follows:
 * First,
 * • If the URI that is the value of s1 has not yet been accessed by an import
 *   or export directive in the current isolate then the contents of the URI
 *   are compiled to yield a library B.
 * • Otherwise, the contents of the URI denoted by s1 have been compiled into
 *   a library B within the current isolate.
 * Let NS0 be the exported namespace of B. Then, for each combinator clause
 * Ci, i in 1..n in E:
 * • If Ci is of the form show id1, ..., idk then let
 *   NSi = show([id1, ..., idk], NSi-1).
 * • If Ci is of the form hide id1, ..., idk then let
 *   NSi = hide([id1, ..., idk], NSi-1).
 *
 * For each entry mapping key k to declaration d in NSn an entry mapping k to
 * d is added to the exported namespace of L unless a top-level declaration
 * with the name k exists in L.
 *
 * @description Checks that referencing exported but undefined name cause
 * compile error
 * @compile-error
 * @note Most of this is already covered by 1_Imports_A02* tests.
